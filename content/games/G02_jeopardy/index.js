    objective: 'Teams pick a category and a value, argue in English, and the teacher reveals — thirteen boards. Nine are Year 7: Mathematics 1.1–1.3, Science 1.1–1.3, a revision board drawn from all six units, a Unit 1 finale covering Maths 1.4–1.6, Science 1.4 and two rounds of classroom trivia, Science Unit 2 (2.1–2.7) with a photograph, symbol or particle diagram on almost every clue, Mathematics Unit 2 with 3.1–3.2, Science 2.4 + 2.8 (the water cycle, acids and alkalis), Science 3.1 with Maths 4.1–4.2 (gravity, weight and mass; comparing, adding and subtracting decimals), the first board in English and French, and Maths Unit 4 with Science 3.1–3.2 (multiplying and dividing decimals, shortcuts, money and the mean; the contact force, weight on Mars, and how the Solar System formed). Two are for the Teens class and are the hardest: IGCSE chemistry and physics, word history, pop songs and big numbers, then a second board of all trivia: myth or fact, celebrity couples, famous covers, geography and accidental inventions. One is for Kindergarten and Year 1 — cooking and first science, read aloud by the teacher, with a photograph on almost every answer. The last is Year 1 only: twenty-five picture clues in five columns — In the Kitchen, Food, Dishes from the World, Claps and Which Is…?',
    order: 2,
    // FR joins the switch for the boards built from Unit 4 on, when Year 7 went
    // English and French. VN stays, because the older boards are Vietnamese.
