    objective:
      'A standalone task: a set of girls share a number of pieces of rice paper under rules like "Carrot gets twice as many as Erica" and "Nam gets 3 more than Su", and students find every share before the clock runs out. ' +
      'The route in is a box, drawn first and then named n — so "twice as many" is 2n and "3 more than" is n + 3. Every share is written as an expression, all of them are added up and set equal to the total, that equation is tidied and solved down to n, and n goes back in to give each girl her number. ' +
      'Ten rounds, from two girls and one rule up to all eight in an arithmetic staircase, each worth more rolls than the last. ' +
      'The three phrases the whole task turns on are "twice as many as", "more than" and "fewer than" — this is a reading task with algebra attached, which is exactly the difficulty this class actually has.',
