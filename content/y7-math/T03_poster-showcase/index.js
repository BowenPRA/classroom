    objective:
      'The launch for the end-of-Quarter-1 showcase. Each student makes one A3 poster that teaches one topic from the quarter to their parents, and explains it in one minute on the day. ' +
      'The deck asks what a parent would need before it answers with a seven-part checklist — title, key words, a picture, how it works, two examples, a common mistake, and a Try it! question under a flap — ' +
      'shown on a finished example poster on square roots, a topic nobody is given. The ten topics are dealt out on a board that uses the Pick button\'s class list and remembers the result on the classroom computer. ' +
      'It ends with the one-minute explanation, modelled by Mr Bowen and then copied as a five-sentence frame.',
