    title: 'Task: The Formula Machine',
    objective:
      'A standalone task following 2.2. Students take one formula at a time and run six different sets of values through it, with the diagram redrawing for every set: perimeter of a rectangle, ' +
      'area of a triangle (where the height is the dashed line and never the slanted side), Celsius to Fahrenheit, and the distance to a storm from the seconds between the flash and the bang. ' +
      'Every problem is worked in three lines — write the formula, put the numbers in, work it out — because the middle line is where the marks and the mistakes both live. ' +
      'Part 2 turns the question round: water is poured from one tank into another with a different base, and the depth it reaches is the letter that was NOT given. ' +
      'The way in is counting centimetre cubes — how many altogether, how many in one layer, divide — not rearranging a formula.',
