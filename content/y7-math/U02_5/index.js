      'Say what an equation is and what solve means; check an answer by substituting it back in, so x − 4 = 6 gives x = 10 and not 2; ' +
      'use inverse operations and reverse the flow chart to solve one-step equations, written either way round; ' +
      'turn "I think of a number…" into an equation and solve it; ' +
      'and solve two-step equations by undoing the last step first, so 2a + 4 = 18 gives a = 7.',
