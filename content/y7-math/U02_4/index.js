      'Say what brackets are and what expand and multiply out mean; know that 4(10 + 6) means 4 × (10 + 6); ' +
      'use the grid to multiply every term inside the brackets by the number outside, so 5(a + 3) = 5a + 15; ' +
      'take the sign in with its term, so 3(x − 2) = 3x − 6; multiply the numbers and keep the letter, so 5 × 2p = 10p; ' +
      'stop at 12 − 4c because 12 and 4c are not like terms; and expand and simplify in that order, ' +
      'so 3(x + 2) + 4x = 7x + 6.',
