    title: 'Using Expressions and Formulae',
    objective:
      'Substitute a number in place of a letter and give the value; know that 3n with n = 4 is 12 and never 34, because the times sign was only ever hidden; keep the order of operations after substituting, so 3x + 2 with x = 4 is 14 and not 18; say what a formula is and why — unlike an expression — it has an = sign; substitute into a formula with two letters such as A = lw; carry a minus sign into the expression with the number it belongs to, using brackets; and recognise that a formula stops being true when the situation it describes does.',
