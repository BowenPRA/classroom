      'say what an inequality and an integer are, and know that an inequality can have many answers; ' +
      'show an inequality on a number line with an open circle and an arrow, and write the inequality a number line shows; ' +
      'and give the smallest or largest integer that works, so x > 3 gives 4 and t < −2 gives −3, −4, −5, …',
