// Unit 3.2 Maths Modelling: Coffee, Carbon and Stars — one period on the
// half-life, told through Mr Bowen and his coffee, carbon dating, and the Sun
// as a hydrogen clock. It was Part 2 of Models: Space and Time until it became
// a deck of its own (order 16.6, after Models: Space). How Old Is the Earth?
// (U03_earth) carries on from it. English and French only, like every Year 7
// deck from 15 October.
