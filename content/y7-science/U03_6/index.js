// Science 3.6 Changes in energy, one period, on the shape of Coffee, Carbon
// and Stars, 3.4 and 3.5: a starter question, three goals (change it, draw it,
// follow it), a stepper to say first, two votes, a game for the whole class
// standing with 3.5's eight actions, Mr Bowen's candle story, real photographs
// and film, and a checklist that ticks off the goals. English and French
// only, like every Year 7 deck from 15 October 2026.
