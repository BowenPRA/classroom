// Unit 2 of the Learner's Book ends at 2.7, so this section has no book pages
// behind it. It is built to the Cambridge Lower Secondary Stage 7 chemistry
// content instead — acids, alkalis, indicators, the pH scale and
// neutralisation — and it leans on 2.5 (elements) and 2.7 (mixtures) only for
// the habit of naming a substance, never for their content.
