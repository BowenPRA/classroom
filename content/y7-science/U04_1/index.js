// Coffee, Carbon and Stars and 3.4–3.7: a starter from the book's Getting
// started, three goals (spot it, name them, test it), the book's polar bears a
// letter a press (MRS GREN), a vote on respiration, an English check on
// "sensitive" and a film of the sensitive plant, Mr Bowen's pet rock, a game
// for the whole class standing, the book's car activity checked against the
// seven, Questions 1–7, and a checklist that ticks off the goals. Built from

    objective:
      'Say whether something is a living organism; list the seven characteristics of living organisms — movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, ' +
      'reproduction, excretion and nutrition — and say what each means; explain that a living organism does all seven, so a car, fire or a rock is not alive.',
