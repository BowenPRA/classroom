// A standalone science-track model, discovered by the registry exactly like a
// lesson. One slide, one interactive: change the temperature and watch a
// substance move through all three states, with the particles shown beside it.
// It is the companion to 2.2 (U02_2a Changes of State, U02_2b Measuring), so it
// sits right after them (order 8.5).
