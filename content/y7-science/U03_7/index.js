// Science 3.7 Where does energy go?, one period, on the shape of Coffee,
// Carbon and Stars, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6: a starter question, three goals (sort
// it, count it, chase it), a stepper to say first, two votes, a game for the
// whole class standing, Mr Bowen's bag of heat, a model of heat spreading
// out, real photographs, and a checklist that ticks off the goals. Built from
// Learner's Book pages 117–119 only. English and French only, like every
// Year 7 deck from 15 October 2026.

    subtitle: 'Sort it, count it, chase it: useful and wasted energy, the two lamps, and energy that spreads out for good',
    objective:
      'Sort the energy from a change into useful and wasted energy; compare how much two lamps waste using percentages; ' +
      'explain that wasted energy is dissipated — it spreads out where there is no use for it and can never be recovered — ' +
      'and that some energy is dissipated every time energy is changed or transferred.',
