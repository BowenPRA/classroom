// A Unit 3 modelling deck, taught after 3.2 Formation of the Solar System and
// before 3.3 Movement in Space (order 16.5): the Solar System as a working
// scale model, the two kinds of model, limitations and the nebula model.
// Its old Part 2 on time is now two decks of its own: Coffee, Carbon and Stars
// (U03_coffee, 16.6) and How Old Is the Earth? (U03_earth, 16.7), which borrow
// this folder's shared pieces (data.js, ui.jsx, space.js). English and French
// only, like every Year 7 deck from 15 October.
