// Science 3.5 Energy, one period, built on the shape of Coffee, Carbon and
// Stars and 3.4 Tides: a starter question, three goals (how much, what kind,
// how long), a stepper to say first, two votes, a game for the whole class
// standing, Mr Bowen's coffee story, real photographs and a launch, and a
// checklist that ticks off the goals. English and French only, like every
// Year 7 deck from 15 October 2026.

      'Say what energy is and measure it in joules; recall and describe the five energy stores (kinetic, chemical, thermal, ' +
      'elastic potential, gravitational potential) and the three transfers (electrical, sound, light — thermal is both), with an ' +
      'example of each; and explain why chemical and gravitational potential stores last a long time while thermal and kinetic stores do not.',
