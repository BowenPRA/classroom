// The random-student picker's state. Lives in its own module (not beside the
// components in RandomStudent.jsx) so React Fast Refresh keeps working — a file
// that exports both components and a hook trips the only-export-components rule.
//
// The roster is saved on THIS DEVICE (localStorage) and nowhere else, so the
// classroom machine keeps Mr Bowen's list and it never leaves the room. Every
// read and write is wrapped, because localStorage throws in private windows and
// in the thumbnail/preview contexts, and a picker that crashes the deck is worse
// than one that forgets the list.
//
// "No repeats" is the point of the tool over a mental coin-flip: it draws
// without replacement until everyone has had a turn, so the quiet students get
// called on as often as the loud ones. That round-state is in-memory only —
// reloading starts a fresh round, which is the right behaviour for a new lesson.
